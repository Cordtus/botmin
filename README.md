I understand the requirement. Here's the corrected logic to ensure the command message is deleted after processing the reply and performing the actions:

1. **Install the necessary packages:**

```shell
yarn add telegraf dotenv
```

2. **Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your `bot.js` file and add your bot token:**

```shell
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
```

3. ** Run the Bot:**

```bash
node bot.js
```

### Explanation:
1. **Environment Variables**: The `dotenv` package is used to load environment variables from the `.env` file.
2. **Bot Token**: The bot token is loaded from the `.env` file using `process.env.BOT_TOKEN`.
3. **Error Handling**: If the bot token is not provided, an error is thrown.
4. **Group Check**: The bot checks if the message is in the specified group by comparing `message.chat.id` with `groupId`. If the message is not from the specified group, the bot returns early and does nothing.
5. **Admin Check**: The `isAdmin` function checks if a user ID is in the list of admin user IDs.
6. **Message Handling**: The bot listens for any text messages, checks if the message is in the specified group, and processes the command if the message is a reply to another message.
7. **Commands**:
   - `#s`: Deletes the replied-to message, mutes the user by restricting their ability to send messages.
   - `#a`: Unmutes the user by allowing them to send messages.
   - `#d`: Deletes the replied-to message.
   - `#q`: Deletes the replied-to message, bans the user from the chat.
   - `#x`: Deletes the replied-to message, kicks the user from the chat.
8. **Non-admin Handling**: If the user issuing the command is not an admin, the bot replies with "Only admins can use the chat controller".
9. **Command Message Deletion**: The command message is deleted after processing.
